# Personal Website
A simple carousel viewer for cycling through [/r/gifs](http://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/). This website is hosted with Google App Engine at [clever-spirit-808.appspot.com](http://clever-spirit-808.appspot.com/). As of now, the carousel only goes through the first page on the newest tab in /r/gifs.
## Dependencies
- [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/)

## Todo
- Be able to view gifs past the first page
- Be able to view gifs on the other tabs (new, top, etc.)
- Be able to go to the nth gif instead of just cycling to it
- Add swiping for mobile and left/right arrow navigation
